# gfx-by-stone

Old-skool graphics I made for the Commodore 64 computer in the previous millenium. 
Most of these were created in Koala Painter using a joystick to place every single pixel. 
They appear in various demos and are here ordered by csdb release ID, which is most probably not the order in which they were created.
